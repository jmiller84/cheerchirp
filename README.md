# TwitterStyle AI-Powered Social Media App

Welcome to our Twitter-style application developed during my tenure at Makers Academy Bootcamp! This application addresses the prevalent issue of negative and toxic comments on social media platforms by leveraging the capabilities of AI. We have integrated ChatGPT's API to analyze user messages and determine whether they are positive or negative. If a message is identified as negative, the application prompts the user to rewrite it.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes ChatGPT's API to assess the sentiment of user messages.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Flags negative messages and prompts users to rewrite them for a more positive tone.
- **Built with Flask and Postgres:** The application is crafted in Python using the Flask framework, with a Postgres database to securely store user and post information.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply sign up or log in to the application. Once authenticated, users can contribute to the message board by posting messages. Join us in fostering a positive online environment!
